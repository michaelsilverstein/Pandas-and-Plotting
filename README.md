# Pandas-and-Plotting
Lessons on using pandas and plotting the data within (( \m/ -_- \m/ ))

These assignments are generally for > beginners to `pandas` and plotting in Python. My goal is to create tasks that reveal common challenges that will require you to work through how to solve them. This will require a lot of Googling and documentation scraping as this in and of itself is a skill required to become a good programmer :).

# Assignments
The "assignments" listed here are partially completed Jupyter notebooks with accompanying instructions. You can view the assignments in your browser, but to actually complete them you will clone this repository and then open them in Jupyter like any other `.ipynb` file. I have saved solutions separately so feel free to email me if you're looking for those :).
## 1. [Weight timeseries data](assignments/weight_timeseries/weight_timeseries_assignment.ipynb)
A mock datasets of the weight of twenty different people over time. Explores data transformations, merging, aggregating, and plotting.
