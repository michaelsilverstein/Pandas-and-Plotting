# Pandas-and-Plotting
Lessons on using pandas and plotting the data within (( \m/ -_- \m/ ))

These assignments are generally for > beginners to `pandas` and plotting in Python. My goal is to create tasks that reveal common challenges that will require you to work through how to solve them. This will require a lot of Googling and documentation scraping as this in and of itself is a skill required to become a good programmer :).
